However, this requirement is not satisfied for some conventional time domain solvers, which were developed for time-invariant simulations.

The recently introduced antireflection temporal coatings (ATCs) [Optica7, 323 (2020)10.1364/OPTICA.381175] have been considered as its temporal analog. However, our study shows that by introducing an ATC, not only will the reflection be reduced but also the transmission. This phenomenon is opposite its spatial counterpart, which indicates that ATCs are more than simply a temporal dual of quarter-wavelength matching.

To distinguish 2D and 3D domains properly, the field distribution has to be known before it is actually solved.

However, in the latest reported technique, this kind of criterion is derived from the causality principle and the Courant–Freidrichs–Lewy constraint, and thus is indirect and inessential to 2-D simplification. As a result, some elements capable of 2-D simplification are unnecessarily flagged as 3-D ones, deteriorating efficiency dramatically.
