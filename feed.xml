The method utilizes a modified Drude-Lorentz resonator representation inspired by optical material dispersion modeling to create multiple sub-circuits based on determined resonances in the impedance spectrum. Each computed sub-circuit is necessarily composed of physically realizable resistors, capacitors, and inductors, and they are connected in series to accurately reconstruct the device’s corresponding impedance characteristics over a specified region of interest. The process is automated and applicable to a wide range of antennas and electromagnetic devices with multiple resonance phenomena. Current equivalent circuit design methods are limited by a lack of generalization and can require complex, active, or non-realizable circuit topologies. The proposed Drude-Lorentz-based approach can provide valuable insight into an antenna’s resonant behavior while remaining general-purpose and only requiring passive components which are physically realizable. This improved generality is achieved by not requiring physical insights, but rather only utilizing the impedance data alone. Additionally, the method creates simpler circuits than other general methods, requiring less components and component types. This method is employed to create equivalent circuits of four different exemplary types of antennas, a patch antenna, a loop antenna, a spherical helix antenna, and a metantenna unit cell. The impedances generated from these circuit examples are compared with results of their full-wave simulation counterparts and found to be in excellent agreement.</p>

Specifically, we express any input signal and its corresponding output in the wave-number domain. Then, the transfer function for the LSI time-varying system can be extracted as a one-time computation by evaluating the ratio of the output signal to the input signal in the wave-number domain. Once the transfer function is extracted, the output response to any input with an arbitrary temporal profile can be computed instantaneously. Furthermore, for a system with a complicated temporal profile, the proposed method allows us to decompose it into several simpler subsystems that appear sequentially in time. The transfer function of that complicated system can be expressed as the product of those of the individual subsystems, such that it can be evaluated more efficiently.</p>

However, few discussions have focused on the underlying physical difference between spatial and temporal boundaries. In this letter, we thoroughly investigate those differences from the perspective of conservation laws. By doing so, the building blocks of optics and electromagnetics such as the reflection law, Snell’s law, and Fresnel’s equations can be analogously derived in a temporal context, but with completely different interpretations.

                    As an important theoretical concept, temporal boundaries provide researchers with new insights for tailoring electromagnetic waves in the time domain. Because a temporal boundary breaks the time translation symmetry, a source is necessary to satisfy energy conservation. In this Letter, we quantify the relationship between refractive index contrast and the required energy exchange. More specifically, to realize a temporal boundary with a large refractive index contrast, a correspondingly large and abrupt energy exchange is required. Considering this practical difficulty, we propose to mimic a large-contrast temporal boundary by staggering a series of small-contrast temporal boundaries separated by carefully designed durations.

Considering this practical difficulty, we propose to mimic a large-contrast temporal boundary by staggering a series of small-contrast temporal boundaries separated by carefully designed durations. In this way, the process of energy input/output is distributed over an elongated duration, but their effect can still be cumulative. This process is analogous to a multi-resonant system with a periodic energy input. Based on this design principle, we discuss several scenarios for different temporal profiles of refractive index and their corresponding energy requirements.</p>

                <p>Various dispersion models can be expressed as special cases of the Generalized Dispersion Model (GDM), which is composed of a series of Pade polynomials. While important for its broad applicability, we found that some materials with Drude dispersive terms can be accurately modeled by mixing a 1st order Pade polynomial with an extra conductivity term. This conductivity term can be separated from the auxiliary differential equation (ADE). Therefore, the proposed mixed-order model can achieve the same accuracy with fewer unknowns, thus realizing higher computational efficiency and lower memory consumption. For examples, we derive the model parameters and corresponding numerical errors for noble metals including Au, Ag, and Al in the optical regime. Finally, the proposed model&amp;#x2019;s efficiency improvements are validated through implementation within a Discontinuous Galerkin Time Domain (DGTD) framework. The proposed model can achieve up to 12.5&amp;#x0025; efficiency improvement in theory compared to the conventional GDM with the same accuracy. A numerical example validates that, in practice, 9&amp;#x0025; memory reduction and 11&amp;#x0025; acceleration can be realized.</p>
