                <p>Optical activity is the ability of chiral materials to rotate linearly polarized electromagnetic waves. A knotted chiral metamolecule is introduced here that exhibits strong optical activity corresponding to a 90° polarization rotation of the incident waves. More importantly, the torus knot structure is intrinsically chiral and multifold axisymmetric. Consequently, the observed polarization rotation behavior is found to be independent of how the incident wave is polarized. The metamolecule is fabricated through selective laser melting and experimentally validated in the microwave spectrum. This work represents the first ever metamolecule to be reported that is intrinsically axisymmetric and capable of simultaneously exhibiting strong optical activity.</p>

                <p>Various dispersion models can be expressed as special cases of the Generalized Dispersion Model (GDM), which is composed of a series of Pad&amp;#x00E9; polynomials. While important for its broad applicability, we found that some materials with Drude dispersive terms can be accurately modeled by mixing a 1st order Pad&amp;#x00E9; polynomial with an extra conductivity term. This conductivity term can be separated from the auxiliary differential equation (ADE). Therefore, the proposed mixed-order model can achieve the same accuracy with fewer unknowns, thus realizing higher computational efficiency and lower memory consumption. For examples, we derive the model parameters and corresponding numerical errors for noble metals including Au, Ag, and Al in the optical regime. Finally, the proposed model&amp;#x2019;s efficiency improvements are validated through implementation within a Discontinuous Galerkin Time Domain (DGTD) framework. The proposed model can achieve up to 12.5&amp;#x0025; efficiency improvement in theory compared to the conventional GDM with the same accuracy. A numerical example validates that, in practice, 9&amp;#x0025; memory reduction and 11&amp;#x0025; acceleration can be realized.</p>

From Maxwell's equations, the electric displacement (D) must be continuous in the time domain. However, this requirement is not satisfied for some conventional time domain solvers, which were developed for time-invariant simulations. Here we briefly review several commercial and open-source software packages. Some of them employ a so-called time-static simplification, which works well for time-invariant materials but will fail for time-varying materials.</p>

The recently introduced antireflection temporal coatings (ATCs) [Optica7, 323 (2020)10.1364/OPTICA.381175] have been considered as its temporal analog. However, our study shows that by introducing an ATC, not only will the reflection be reduced but also the transmission. This phenomenon is opposite its spatial counterpart, which indicates that ATCs are more than simply a temporal dual of quarter-wavelength matching. This is a direct consequence of the different physical phenomena that are manifested in the temporal and spatial domains.</p>

However, most of the related research has been focused on time-invariant systems. Inspired by the concept of temporal boundaries, we propose a method to realize polarization conversion in real time by employing time-variant materials, whose permittivity or permeability switches between isotropic and anisotropic values. The criteria for complete polarization conversion are studied for several polarization angles, both analytically and numerically.</p>

The MDM equation is coupled with Maxwell’s equations and solved together through the auxiliary differential equation (ADE) method. A Runge-Kutta time-stepping scheme is proposed to update the semi-discrete transformed Maxwell’s equations and ADEs with high order accuracy. Then we employ the proposed algorithm to analyze an infinite doubly periodic frequency selective surface (FSS) operating in the optical regime that exhibits transmission enhancement due to the surface plasmatic effect. The accuracy and the efficiency enhancements are validated through a comparison with commercial simulation software. This work represents the first integration of MDM with DGTD, which enables the DGTD algorithm to efficiently analyze metallic structures in the optical regime.</p>

These neurological degenerative diseases often occur along with some mark proteins. Instilled by golden nanoparticles, these protein cells can demonstrate optical activity because of their helical structure. In order to detect these mark proteins, we developed a numerical method to simulate the electromagnetic response upon chiral (bi-isotropic) material. The chiral proteins in human head can therefore be detected. The primitive simulation results suggest that the proposed method would be capable of carrying out in vivo detection of neurological degenerative disease using microwaves.</p>

<h2>This simulation package is the prism-based Discontinuous Galerkin Time Domain method with General Dispersion Model for analysis of gold pixelized metasurfaces.</h2>
<h2>How to use it:</h2>
<p>Open "runme.m" in MATLAB. Modify the time span and the Geo matrix "A". The geometry is a 2-fold symmetric unit cell with a period of 400 nm. The unit cell can be patterned by several gold pixels, measures 50 nm × 50 nm × 20 nm. In order to add gold padding, one could input the number of padding, and then the index numbering. The index number ascends along x- and y- axes, as depicted in below figures. <img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/maiwending/pDGTD_GDM/blob/master/readme_fig/1.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="image"></p>
<p>Modify the material GDM parameters.</p>
<p>The MATLAB script will automatically call the pDGTD simulation toolkit, and then the postprocessing programe to plot the transmission and reflection of the metasurface. It will depict the transmission and reflection response in time-domain and frequency-domain (400 nm – 2000 nm). Currently, it only gives results upon x-polarized excitation. <img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/maiwending/pDGTD_GDM/blob/master/readme_fig/2.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="image"></p>
<h2>Computational efficiency comparison:</h2>
<p>For the default example, the CPU times of different method are listed below:</p>
<p>pDGTD Default mode: 2000 s.</p>
<p>pDGTD RELEASE mode: 180 s.</p>
<p>CST Studio Software: 662 s.</p>
<h2>Dependencies:</h2>
<p>In the latest version, the MKL dependency has been removed.</p>

                <p>Planar photonics technology is expected to facilitate new physics and enhanced functionality for a new generation of disruptive optical devices. To analyze such planar optical metasurfaces efficiently, we propose a prismatic discontinuous Galerkin time domain (DGTD) method with a generalized dispersive material (GDM) model to conduct the full-wave electromagnetic simulation of planar photonic nanostructures. Prism-based DGTD allows for triangular prismatic space discretization, which is optimal for planar geometries. In order to achieve an accurate universal model for arbitrary dispersive materials, the GDM model is integrated within the prism-based DGTD. As an advantage of prismatic spatial discretization, the prism-based DGTD with GDM has fewer elements than conventional tetrahedral methods, which in turn brings higher computational efficiency. Finally, the accuracy, convergence behavior, and efficiency improvements of the proposed algorithm is validated by several numerical examples. A simulation toolkit with the proposed algorithm has been released online, enabling users to efficiently analyze metasurfaces with customized pixel patterns.</p>

                <p>Stroke is a dangerous disease with a high recurrence rate. Therefore, postoperative patients need timely monitoring of stroke conditions in their rehabilitation stage for early treatment. Recent studies in biomedical imaging have shown that strokes produce variations in the electric permittivity of brain tissues, which can be detected by microwave imaging techniques. Assuming that we have obtained the image of electromagnetic parameters in previous treatment, we can use differential imaging to detect the bleeding points when stroke recurs. However, the computational cost of traditional methods could be prohibitively large, as the bleeding points are small in the early stages of recurrence and the data of scatterers are sparse. Compressive sensing is a potential candidate for efficient microwave imaging algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new method for microwave differential imaging. The difference of the scattering field is related to sparse unknown scatterers by the Green's function of the inhomogeneous medium. An improved simultaneous stagewise weak orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm is then proposed to solve the problem in the framework of compressive sensing. The numerical results validate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.</p>
