The method utilizes a modified Drude-Lorentz resonator representation inspired by optical material dispersion modeling to create multiple sub-circuits based on determined resonances in the impedance spectrum. Each computed sub-circuit is necessarily composed of physically realizable resistors, capacitors, and inductors, and they are connected in series to accurately reconstruct the device‚Äôs corresponding impedance characteristics over a specified region of interest. The process is automated and applicable to a wide range of antennas and electromagnetic devices with multiple resonance phenomena. Current equivalent circuit design methods are limited by a lack of generalization and can require complex, active, or non-realizable circuit topologies. The proposed Drude-Lorentz-based approach can provide valuable insight into an antenna‚Äôs resonant behavior while remaining general-purpose and only requiring passive components which are physically realizable. This improved generality is achieved by not requiring physical insights, but rather only utilizing the impedance data alone. Additionally, the method creates simpler circuits than other general methods, requiring less components and component types. This method is employed to create equivalent circuits of four different exemplary types of antennas, a patch antenna, a loop antenna, a spherical helix antenna, and a metantenna unit cell. The impedances generated from these circuit examples are compared with results of their full-wave simulation counterparts and found to be in excellent agreement.</p>

Specifically, we express any input signal and its corresponding output in the wave-number domain. Then, the transfer function for the LSI time-varying system can be extracted as a one-time computation by evaluating the ratio of the output signal to the input signal in the wave-number domain. Once the transfer function is extracted, the output response to any input with an arbitrary temporal profile can be computed instantaneously. Furthermore, for a system with a complicated temporal profile, the proposed method allows us to decompose it into several simpler subsystems that appear sequentially in time. The transfer function of that complicated system can be expressed as the product of those of the individual subsystems, such that it can be evaluated more efficiently.</p>

Because a temporal boundary breaks the time translation symmetry, a source is necessary to satisfy energy conservation.

More specifically, to realize a temporal boundary with a large refractive index contrast, a correspondingly large and abrupt energy exchange is required.

In this way, the process of energy input/output is distributed over an elongated duration, but their effect can still be cumulative. This process is analogous to a multi-resonant system with a periodic energy input. Based on this design principle, we discuss several scenarios for different temporal profiles of refractive index and their corresponding energy requirements.</p>

                    Opening a new door to tailoring electromagnetic (EM) waves, temporal boundaries have attracted the attention of researchers in recent years, which have led to many intriguing applications. However, the current theoretical approaches are far from enough to handle the complicated temporal systems. In this paper, we develop universal matrix formalism, paired with a unique coordinate transformation technique.

                <p>Opening a new door to tailoring electromagnetic (EM) waves, temporal boundaries have attracted the attention of researchers in recent years, which have led to many intriguing applications. However, the current theoretical approaches are far from enough to handle the complicated temporal systems. In this paper, we develop universal matrix formalism, paired with a unique coordinate transformation technique. The approach can effectively deal with temporally stratified structures with complicated material anisotropy and arbitrary incidence angles. This formulation is applied to various practical systems, enabling the solution of these temporal boundary related problems in a simple and elegant fashion, and also facilitating a deep insight into the fundamental physics.</p>

                    Temporal boundary value problems (TBVPs) provide the foundation for analyzing electromagnetic wave propagation in time-varying media. In this paper, we point out that TBVPs fall into the category of unbounded initial value problems, which have traveling wave solutions. By dividing the entire time frame into several subdomains and applying the d‚ÄôAlembert formula, the transient expressions for waves propagating through temporal boundaries can be evaluated analytically. Moreover, unlike their spatial analogs, TBVPs are subject to causality. Therefore, the resulting analytical transient solutions resulting from the d‚ÄôAlembert formula are unique to temporal systems.

                    Optical activity is the ability of chiral materials to rotate linearly polarized electromagnetic waves. A knotted chiral metamolecule is introduced here that exhibits strong optical activity corresponding to a 90¬∞ polarization rotation of the incident waves. More importantly, the torus knot structure is intrinsically chiral and multifold axisymmetric. Consequently, the observed polarization rotation behavior is found to be independent of how the incident wave is polarized. The metamolecule is fabricated through selective laser melting and experimentally validated in the microwave spectrum.
