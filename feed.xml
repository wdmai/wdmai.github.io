We call these unique knotted structures chiral balls. Moreover, chirality can bring about polarization transformation in electromagnetic waves. As a consequence of their 3D rotational symmetry, we further expect the polarization transformation performance of chiral balls to exhibit ultra-wide angle-independent behavior. Such a remarkable property has not been previously reported on in the literature. As a case study, we investigate the intrinsic electromagnetic scattering properties of a representative conductive chiral ball using characteristic mode analysis and then further verify them by measuring its radiation performance. The result shows that the chiral ball can exhibit an unprecedented extraordinary omnidirectional circularly polarized electromagnetic scattering property. Because of their unique properties, chiral balls are expected to not only have a profound impact on the fields of electromagnetics and optics but also potentially far beyond. </p>

The method utilizes a modified Drude-Lorentz resonator representation inspired by optical material dispersion modeling to create multiple sub-circuits based on determined resonances in the impedance spectrum. Each computed sub-circuit is necessarily composed of physically realizable resistors, capacitors, and inductors, and they are connected in series to accurately reconstruct the device’s corresponding impedance characteristics over a specified region of interest. The process is automated and applicable to a wide range of antennas and electromagnetic devices with multiple resonance phenomena. Current equivalent circuit design methods are limited by a lack of generalization and can require complex, active, or non-realizable circuit topologies. The proposed Drude-Lorentz-based approach can provide valuable insight into an antenna’s resonant behavior while remaining general-purpose and only requiring passive components which are physically realizable. This improved generality is achieved by not requiring physical insights, but rather only utilizing the impedance data alone. Additionally, the method creates simpler circuits than other general methods, requiring less components and component types. This method is employed to create equivalent circuits of four different exemplary types of antennas, a patch antenna, a loop antenna, a spherical helix antenna, and a metantenna unit cell. The impedances generated from these circuit examples are compared with results of their full-wave simulation counterparts and found to be in excellent agreement.</p>

Specifically, we express any input signal and its corresponding output in the wave-number domain. Then, the transfer function for the LSI time-varying system can be extracted as a one-time computation by evaluating the ratio of the output signal to the input signal in the wave-number domain. Once the transfer function is extracted, the output response to any input with an arbitrary temporal profile can be computed instantaneously. Furthermore, for a system with a complicated temporal profile, the proposed method allows us to decompose it into several simpler subsystems that appear sequentially in time. The transfer function of that complicated system can be expressed as the product of those of the individual subsystems, such that it can be evaluated more efficiently.</p>

In this letter, we thoroughly investigate those differences from the perspective of conservation laws. By doing so, the building blocks of optics and electromagnetics such as the reflection law, Snell’s law, and Fresnel’s equations can be analogously derived in a temporal context, but with completely different interpretations.

Because a temporal boundary breaks the time translation symmetry, a source is necessary to satisfy energy conservation.

In this way, the process of energy input/output is distributed over an elongated duration, but their effect can still be cumulative. This process is analogous to a multi-resonant system with a periodic energy input. Based on this design principle, we discuss several scenarios for different temporal profiles of refractive index and their corresponding energy requirements.</p>

Moreover, unlike their spatial analogs, TBVPs are subject to causality. Therefore, the resulting analytical transient solutions resulting from the d’Alembert formula are unique to temporal systems.</p>

A knotted chiral metamolecule is introduced here that exhibits strong optical activity corresponding to a 90° polarization rotation of the incident waves.
