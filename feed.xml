                <p>A hybrid 2-D and 3-D discontinuous Garlerkin time-domain (DGTD) method is proposed for transient analysis of multiple arbitrarily shaped antipads in a dispersive parallel-plate pair. In the proposed hybrid method, the domains where only the zeroth-order parallel-plate mode exists are modeled by the 2-D DGTD, and the remaining domains are modeled by the 3-D DGTD. Each element is independent with others, thus easily parallelizable. Because higher order modes will propagate in the parallel-plate pair, the spatial domain decomposition should be time-dependent. For domain decomposition criterion at time step t <sub>n</sub> , the electromagnetic field distribution at the previous time step t <sub>n-1</sub> is analyzed to identify the zeroth-order parallel mode domain. Compared with the classical static distance criterion, this new adaptive criterion makes the approximation error under control, thus enhancing the stability. The accuracy and flexibility of the hybrid method have been validated by comparison with commercial software. Its enhancement of efficiency and stability is also demonstrated.</p>
